# Salary Calculator

A simple program to calculate salary of the employee.

### Assumption

The input for "Jumlah jam kerja" is working hours every day only. And for the days working in a month is 20 days. 

Example:

"Jumlah jam kerja" is 9 hours.

If we assume in 1 month = 20 working days, then the overtime allowance is 1 hour, so 1 hour x 20 days = 20 hours.
